## 2.3.1 (27/10/2024)

### Enhancements

- Bumped submodules and improved optimisation settings

**NOTE:** RadeonGadget has been removed. The project is now a single VirtualSMC plug-in. Don't forget to remove the old SMCRadeonGPU/RadeonSensor combination before putting this in. The philosophy behind this is to have as close to native experience as possible. Replacements for RadeonGadget include, but are not limited to, XS-Labs' Hot, exelban's Stats, iStat Menus (paid) and similar.
